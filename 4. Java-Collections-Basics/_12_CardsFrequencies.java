// We are given a sequence of N playing cards from a standard deck. The input consists of several cards (face + 
// suit), separated by a space. Write a program to calculate and print at the console the frequency of each card 
// face in format "card_face -> frequency". The frequency is calculated by the formula appearances / N and is 
// expressed in percentages with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point. The card faces with their frequency 
// should be printed in the order of the card face's first appearance in the input. The same card can appear 
// multiple times in the input, but it's face should be listed only once in the output.
